## about

I'm Elad Gariany, born on Nevember 1986, Tel-Aviv, Israel. I'm a technophile, finding creation as art. I grew up as a music producer and composer, working 24/7 around computers, which turned to be my profession and passion in life. With my background in the music industry I found social networks, business and signal processing subject fascinating.

## technology

After serving the israeli army and 2.5 years into my computer science degree, I co-founded Vidit.fm (2011), a video platform for the creation of crowd-sourced videos. As the Product & CTO, I developed all mobile & backend interfaces. I put special attention on audio signal processing, FFmpeg and AVFoundation libraries.

Building products is my day job.

## arts

From arts to technology, my one true passion in life is creating stuff. At the age of 12 I started composing music on a PC without any theoretical or practical knowledge. While all the other kids were playing around I prefer hacking trough scales, notes and professional music composing tools. At first it was a challenge for me then it become a tool for me to express my feelings and desires.
