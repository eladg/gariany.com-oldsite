                    <p class="content_text">My name is Elad Gariany, born at Nevember 1986, in central Israel. I'm a technophile, finding creation as art. I grew up as a music producer and composer, working 24/7 around computers, which turned to be my profession and passion in life. With my little background in the music industry I found social networks, business and signal processing subject fascinating.</p>

                    <p class="content_text">From arts to technology, my one true passion in life is creating stuff. At the age of 12 I started writing music on a PC. After serving the israeli army and 2 years into my computer science degree, I co-founded Vidit.fm, a social video platform for the creation of crowd-sourced videos. Try it with the link below! As the Product & CTO, I developed all mobile & backend interfaces. Building products is my day job.</p>
